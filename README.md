    * Exploratory Data Analysis was performed using visualizations (as shown in `lung_cancer_detection.ipynb`).

    ##   Model Selection and Training üß†

    * **Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras).

    ##   Model Evaluation ‚úÖ

    Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as:

    * Accuracy Score
    * Classification Report
    * Confusion Matrix

    ##   Results ‚ú®

    The project aimed to build models to detect lung cancer. The results of the model evaluation are detailed in the notebook (`lung_cancer_detection.ipynb`).

    ##   Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
